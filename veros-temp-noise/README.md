# Veros runs with temperature noise

All the following names are found as folders in the `__test__` directory. Since this directory is ignored by git, it contains different runs depending on the cluster.

Each run has a `*_minimal` version that contains only the `*-traj.npy` files and the `info.json` ones. Namely, the minimum information needed to visualize the run. These minimal version do not contain restart files, so they cannot be used to continue runs.
